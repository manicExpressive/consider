Considering
---

A CLI utility to help you write on your website. Pulls data from the iTunes Store API, IGDB from Twitch, and TVDB (future path).

# Getting started

This thing is *almost* functional, but if you want to kick the tires:

```
git clone git@github.com:manicExpressive/consider.git
cd git consider
node install . -g
```

As an example, if you wanted information about Ridley Scott's 2012 film Prometheus you might do something like this:

`consider -h` will send you down the correct path also.
